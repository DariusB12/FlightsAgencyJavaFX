 # University project at Design and Programming Environments 
 # The UI is implemented using JavaFX
 # Requirement:
Several travel agencies use an airline to transport clients to various tourist destinations. Agencies use a software system to buy tickets for tourists. Travel agency employees use a desktop application with the following functionality:
1. SignUp. Create an employee account
2. Login. After successful login, a new window opens displaying flight information (destination, departure date and time, airport and available seat number).
3. Search. After successfully logging in, the employee can search for a flight by entering the destination and departure date. The application will display in another list/another table/etc. all flights for that destination, departure time
and the number of seats available.
4. Purchase. The employee can buy tickets for customers for a specific destination, on a specific date and time of departure. When buying a ticket, the employee enters the customer's name, name
tourists, customer address and number of seats. After buying a ticket, all employees of travel agencies see the updated list of flights and the number of available seats. If for a particular flight
there are no more seats available, that flight will no longer appear in the list of flights displayed on the interface.
